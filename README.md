# Encrypted Notepad

Hi everyone, and welcome to the encrypted notepad app!
Please feel free to test it out and make changes as you see fit!

If you get lost or need a reference, this README.md file is a good resource to use.

## Using git
Using git bash or your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to store this repository.
Run the following command: `git clone git@github.com:johnFFT/encrypted_notepad.git`
If you have any trouble in this step, please feel free to reach out!

If you are going to do any development, I would recommend you make a new branch. There are quite a few resources about doing this online, including [this one](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging). Again, please reach out if this is a road you want to go down!

## Installing python
Navigate to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
(or google search **_download python_**) and download the latest stable release for your OS.

<br>

## Installing packages
Python uses PIP package manager to install libraries. If you are missing a library from this code, google the missing library, and you should see a PyPI page for it.
For example, I google searched **_pip cryptography_** and found the following [web page](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/). 

Note that the top of the page shows you the command to download the package. In this case, it is `pip install cryptography`.
I then navigated to my terminal or power shell window, pasted the command from the webpage, and ran it.

<br>

## Running the app
In your terminal or power shell, navigate to the appropriate directory and run `python app.py`
If you have an error, it may be because you are missing a dependency.
For other issues, do not hesitate to contact me!
